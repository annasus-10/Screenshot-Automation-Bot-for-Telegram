# üì∏ Screenshot Automation Bot for Telegram

> **Born out of boredom**

---

### Why Did I Write This?

So here's the thing... for a certain TE3000 (or any other courses arjan V might teach), we students are left with no choice but to screenshot *everything*. After a while, my desktop started looking like a digital junkyard, and organizing those screenshots became a nightmare.

Enter **this bot**, my savior and (now yours too). Born from a blend of boredom, frustration, and the desire to not lose my sanity, this bot automates the process of **monitoring screenshots** and sending them directly to a **Telegram channel or chat** for safe-keeping.üòä

---

### What Does It Do?

This bot:
- Monitors a folder on your system (e.g., `C:\Temp\Screenshots`) for new files.
- Validates the files (ensures they‚Äôre actual images and not broken).
- Uploads the screenshots directly to a specified Telegram channel or chat.
- Allows you to control the bot via simple Telegram commands (`/start`, `/stop`, `/exit`).

Now you can focus on learning (or pretending to), while this bot ensures your screenshots are always backed up and easily accessible.

### How to Use It?

Here‚Äôs the **step-by-step guide** to get this bot up and running on your machine:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites

- **Python** (version 3.10 or higher). Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- A **Telegram bot** token:
  - Talk to [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather) on Telegram.
  - Create a new bot and grab the API token.
- A **Telegram channel or chat** where you want the bot to send your files. Add the bot as an admin to this chat or channel.

---

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telegram-screenshot-bot.git
   cd telegram-screenshot-bot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Update the script:
   - Open the `AutoFileBot.py` file.
   - Replace the placeholder `BOT_TOKEN` with your bot's token.
   - Replace `CHANNEL_USERNAME` with your Telegram channel or chat ID.

---

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Usage

Run the bot:
```bash
python AutoFileBot.py
```

Then, interact with the bot on Telegram:
- `/start`: Starts monitoring the folder.
- `/stop`: Stops monitoring the folder.
- `/exit`: Shuts down the bot.

Take a screenshot (e.g., `Win + PrtScn`), and watch as the bot uploads it to your Telegram chat!

### Folder Monitoring

By default, the bot monitors the folder:
```
C:\Temp\Screenshots
```
Make sure this folder exists. If not, the bot will create it for you.

If you want to change the folder, update the `folder_to_monitor` variable in the script:
```python
folder_to_monitor = r"Your\Custom\Path"
```

---

### Example Workflow

1. You take a screenshot.
2. The file appears in `C:\Temp\Screenshots`.
3. The bot picks it up, validates it, and uploads it to Telegram.
4. Done. Your screenshot is safely stored in the chat.
